# New Members

Welcome to Decatur Makers! We’re excited that you’re joining us in our mission to Build. Share. Explore. Below you’ll find some important information about Decatur Makers, our community, the building and our tools.  


## **We’re committed to safety**

**We encourage members to act in a manner that is safe for themselves and other members. We ask that** everyone keep ****[**our basic safety guidelines**](https://goo.gl/HWh710) in mind when working in the space.  In particular:  


* Know where the first aid kits and fire extinguishers are located and be familiar with their operation.
* Use safety equipment generously. While working in the space, use eye protection, hearing protection, gloves and aprons to keep yourself safe.  
* Know the safe and appropriate procedures for operating tools. Never use a tool that you have not been cleared to use. If you don’t know how to use a tool, ask for help or training. If you don’t feel comfortable with a piece of equipment, don’t use it, ask for help.
* In an emergency, please call 911.

A safe space is a place where people don’t get hurt.  As a member, you are making a commitment to make sure that you and others in the space are using the equipment safely.

In addition, you are also making a commitment to make sure that you and others in the space are treated with respect and kindness.  We are committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone, including members, volunteers, and guests. [**Our policies**](https://goo.gl/kPVkTt) ****are open for all to review.  


**REQUIREMENT 1:**  All members and guests must sign and submit the [**RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK FORM**](https://goo.gl/gQWwnr) before working on projects inside Decatur Makers.  
**REQUIREMENT 2:**  All members will undergo a basic criminal background check as part of the membership application.

## **Getting inside the space**

Members are welcome to use the space 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, even on holidays. Members under 18 need parental permission to be in the space.  Members aged 14 and up may be in the space without adult supervision. Guests must be accompanied by a member at all times while inside the space. Members under 18 may NOT bring guests without approval of a Decatur Makers board member. Non-member guests are not allowed in the space without a member escort, even on open build nights.

Your key fob will allow you access to the door on the East side of the building.

Light switches are on in the kitchen area, on the right, just before entering the main area.

Keep the door closed in the summer to preserve AC air.  You can leave it unlocked but closed by using the Allen wrench to hold down the crossbar.  If the door is unlocked, people may just wander in \(which is fine, you should welcome them\) but if you don't want to be paying attention to unexpected visitors, keep the door closed and locked.

When you leave, if you're the last one there, check that all doors are closed \(pull them tight, they stick\), turn off the lights, and pull the front door locked. Check the garage door as well as the South side door.
