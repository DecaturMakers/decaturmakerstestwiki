**Background**: The Glowforge is our Laser Cutter/Engraver that was added to the space around Christmas 2017. It was a crowd-sourced product that raised $27M in 30 days. We jumped in at the initial offering but it took years longer than was promised to receive the product. It remains a very interesting tool to have at our makerspace and also a very good case study in marketing/branding/venture capping.

Here's the [video](https://youtu.be/ysCaqh38JVQ) that was instrumental in raising all that cash.

Here's a[ very good analysis](https://kickofflabs.com/blog/biggest-30-day-crowdfunding-campaign-in-history/) of the viral marketing tools by Kickoff Labs that Glowforge used.

### Using The Glowforge

You must take the Glowforge class before you can use our Glowforge. The Calendar of classes is here:

There is a  [Glowforge Community](https://community.glowforge.com/) knowledgebase/forum. In [Tips & Tricks](https://community.glowforge.com/c/glowforge-tips-and-tricks), you will find a very good introduction to [Laser Design Basics](https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/glowforge/original/3X/b/0/b00b9ad2a391e91fed09c640300d439421e832e1.pdf). It has a very good description of the difference between vector and raster image files. The Glowforge uses Vector Images to tell the laser to cut, score, or engrave. **Raster Images are always engraved**. You will need to understand these differences.

#### Living Hinge Documentation:

From wikipedia: A **living hinge** is a thin flexible [hinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge) \([flexure bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexure_bearing)\) made from the same material as the two rigid pieces it connects, rather than [cloth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth), [leather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather), or some other flexible substance. It is typically thinned or cut to allow the rigid pieces to bend along the line of the hinge. The minimal [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction) and very little [wear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear) in such a hinge makes it useful in the design of [microelectromechanical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems), and the low cost and ease of manufacturing makes them quite common in [disposable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable) [packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging).

The Glowforge is great at making living hinges.

ReidB has a [plugin](http://www.reidb.net/LaserLivingHinges.html) to add to Inkscape in order to create your living hinges.
